Overview
The IFC Rush Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline and standardize the fraternity rush process for university students. By integrating AI-driven matching and manual administrative oversight, this application simplifies the recruitment process for both Potential New Members (PNMs) and Fraternity Members.

Vision & Goals
Fraternity recruitment across universities is often disorganized, inefficient, and inconsistent. Our platform seeks to ameliorate these issues by:

Providing a centralized system for students to sign up and indicate their role as a PNM or Fraternity Member.
Leveraging AI-powered recommendations to connect PNMs with fraternities that align with their interests, values, and goals.
Enabling manual matching by admin accounts for further customization and refinement.
Standardizing the rush process across different fraternities to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency.
Improving communication between PNMs, fraternity members, and IFC representatives.
